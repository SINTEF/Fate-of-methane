# Fate-of-methane
A water-column model for the fate of methane from seafloor seeps


The repository includes water column data for temperature, salinity and diffusivity, stored as output from GOTM. Note that the GOTM output NetCDF-files have been reduced to a manageable size by deleting superfluous variables, converting to NetCDF version 4, and adding some compression.
